        It seems that everyone wants to be fit and in good shape. The past two decades have seen people paying more and more attention to health and fitness.
        We have finally realized the overwhelming benefits that attention to our health provides. But, what does it mean to be fit?

Some people equate fitness with losing weight and being slim. But slim people can be unfit also. Other people equate fitness with lots of muscle. Some people think  fitness means being able to do 100 push-ups or run a marathon or compete in athletic events.
        It mans that you possess each of the five components of fitness: cardiovascular, muscular endurance, flexibility and low body fat.

    <div class="paragraph">Fat is an essential part of our diet and nutrition, and we cannot live without it.
    Our bodies require small amounts of 'good fat' to function and help prevent disease. 
     However, a lot of modern diets contain far more fat than the body needs.  Too much fat, especially too much of the wrong type of fat, can cause serious health complaints including obesity, higher blood pressure and cholesterol levels, which in turn lead to a greater risk of heart disease.

    <div class="paragraph">Fat is a concentrated source of energy – 1 gram of fat contains 9 calories, much more than a gram of protein or carbohydrate which both contain 4 calories.  The body can pull on its fat reserves during lean times for energy, converting fat into glucose. 
        Fat provides a cushion to help protect our vital organs – without fat our organs would be more prone to damage.  Furthermore, fat acts as an insulator, helping us to maintain the correct body temperature.
